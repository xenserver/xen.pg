Subject: xen/memory: Don't skip the RCU unlock path in acquire_resource()

In the case that an HVM Stubdomain makes an XENMEM_acquire_resource hypercall,
the FIXME path will bypass rcu_unlock_domain() on the way out of the function.

Move the check to the start of the function.  This does change the behaviour
of the get-size path for HVM Stubdomains, but that functionality is currently
broken and unused anyway, as well as being quite useless to entities which
can't actually map the resource anyway.

This is XSA-334.

Fixes: 83fa6552ce ("common: add a new mappable resource type: XENMEM_resource_grant_table")
