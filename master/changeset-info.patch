Warning! here be dragons.

For versions of Xen before 4.8, the base repository does not have
.gitarchive-info; Fake a suitable one up.  This must be kept in sync
manually.

Because planex processes the patchqueue when creating the srpm, a regular
.gitarchive-info in the patchqueue tarball isn't available to the build
environment.  Fake it up in a patch file to appear as if it were created in
the base tarball.
