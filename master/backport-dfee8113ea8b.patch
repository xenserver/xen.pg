Subject: [PATCH] VMX: fix vmx_{find,del}_msr() build

Older gcc at -O2 (and perhaps higher) does not recognize that apparently
uninitialized variables aren't really uninitialized. Pull out the
assignments used by two of the three case blocks and make them
initializers of the variables, as I think I had suggested during review.
