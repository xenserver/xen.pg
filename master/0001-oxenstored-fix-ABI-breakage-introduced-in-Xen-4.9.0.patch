Subject: [PATCH] oxenstored: fix ABI breakage introduced in Xen 4.9.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

dbc84d2983969bb47d294131ed9e6bbbdc2aec49 (Xen >= 4.9.0) deleted XS_RESTRICT
from oxenstored, which caused all the following opcodes to be shifted by 1:
reset_watches became off-by-one compared to the C version of xenstored.

Looking at the C code the opcode for reset watches needs:
XS_RESET_WATCHES = XS_SET_TARGET + 2

So add the placeholder `Invalid` in the OCaml<->C mapping list.
(Note that the code here doesn't simply convert the OCaml constructor to
 an integer, so we don't need to introduce a dummy constructor).

Igor says that with a suitably patched xenopsd to enable watch reset,
we now see `reset watches` during kdump of a guest in xenstored-access.log.
