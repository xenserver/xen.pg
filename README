This is the repository of XenServer-specific patches to Xen.

For any new features, please work with the upstream Xen project and
request backports by emailing the XenServer development mailing list
(xs-devel@lists.xenserver.org).

Refer to http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Submitting_Xen_Patches for
information on contributing to the Xen project.

This repo a guilt patchqueue.  To set up for use with guilt:

  Clone upstream Xen, create a branch called patchqueue
  $ git clone git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git xen.git
  $ cd xen.git
  $ git branch patchqueue

  Clone this repo into upstream's .git/patches
  $ git clone git@github.com:xenserver/xen.pg.git .git/patches

  Point the patchqueue branch at the patches inside master/
  $ ln -s master .git/patches/patchqueue
  $ touch .git/patches/patchqueue/status

  Push the patchqueue
  $ guilt push -a

As development progresses, the base of the patchqueue moves.  Refer to
xen.spec for the appropriate base to use.  To update the base when it moves:

  Pop the patches
  $ guilt pop -a

  Move the patchqueue branch to the new base
  $ git reset --hard $NEW_BASE

  Push the patchqueue at its new base
  $ guilt push -a

Refer to the specfile for dependenices and build instructions.

Note: Some of the patches in this series introduce hypercall ABI
changes that are incompatible with upstream Xen.
