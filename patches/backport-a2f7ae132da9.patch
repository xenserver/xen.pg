Subject: tools/ocaml/xenstored: only Dom0 can change node owner
MIME-Version: 1.0

Otherwise we can give quota away to another domain, either causing it to run
out of quota, or in case of Dom0 use unbounded amounts of memory and bypass
the quota system entirely.

This was fixed in the C version of xenstored in 2006 (c/s db34d2aaa5f5,
predating the XSA process by 5 years).

It was also fixed in the mirage version of xenstore in 2012, with a unit test
demonstrating the vulnerability:

  https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xenstore/commit/6b91f3ac46b885d0530a51d57a9b3a57d64923a7
  https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xenstore/commit/22ee5417c90b8fda905c38de0d534506152eace6

but possibly without realising that the vulnerability still affected the
in-tree oxenstored (added c/s f44af660412 in 2010).

This is XSA-352.
