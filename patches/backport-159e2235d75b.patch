Subject: x86/spec-ctrl: Only adjust MSR_SPEC_CTRL for idle with legacy IBRS
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Back at the time of the original Spectre-v2 fixes, it was recommended to clear
MSR_SPEC_CTRL when going idle.  This is because of the side effects on the
sibling thread caused by the microcode IBRS and STIBP implementations which
were retrofitted to existing CPUs.

However, there are no relevant cross-thread impacts for the hardware
IBRS/STIBP implementations, so this logic should not be used on Intel CPUs
supporting eIBRS, or any AMD CPUs; doing so only adds unnecessary latency to
the idle path.

Furthermore, there's no point playing with MSR_SPEC_CTRL in the idle paths if
SMT is disabled for other reasons.
