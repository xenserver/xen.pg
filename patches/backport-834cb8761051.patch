Subject: x86/PV32: fix physdev_op_compat handling
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The conversion of the original code failed to recognize that the 32-bit
compat variant of this (sorry, two different meanings of "compat" here)
needs to continue to invoke the compat handler, not the native one.
Arrange for this by adding yet another #define.

Affected functions (having existed prior to the introduction of the new
hypercall) are PHYSDEVOP_set_iobitmap and PHYSDEVOP_apic_{read,write}.
For all others the operand struct layout doesn't differ.

Fixes: 1252e2823117 ("x86/pv: Export pv_hypercall_table[] rather than working around it in several ways")
