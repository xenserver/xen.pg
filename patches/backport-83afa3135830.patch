Subject: amd-vi: fix IVMD memory type checks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current code that parses the IVMD blocks is relaxed with regard to the
restriction that such unity regions should always fall into memory ranges
marked as reserved in the memory map.

However the type checks for the IVMD addresses are inverted, and as a result
IVMD ranges falling into RAM areas are accepted.  Note that having such ranges
in the first place is a firmware bug, as IVMD should always fall into reserved
ranges.

Fixes: ed6c77ebf0c1 ('AMD/IOMMU: check / convert IVMD ranges for being / to be reserved')
