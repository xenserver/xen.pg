Subject: tools/libxc: disable x2APIC when using nested virtualization
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There are issues as reported by osstest when Xen is running nested on
itself and the L1 Xen is using x2APIC. While those are being
investigated, disable announcing the x2APIC feature in CPUID when nested
HVM mode is enabled.
