Subject: x86/cpu-policy: Fix visibility of HTT/CMP_LEGACY in max policies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The block in recalculate_cpuid_policy() predates the proper split between
default and max policies, and was a "slightly max for a toolstack which knows
about it" capability.  It didn't get transformed properly in Xen 4.14.

Because Xen will accept a VM with HTT/CMP_LEGACY seen, they should be visible
in the max polices.  Keep the default policy matching host settings.

This manifested as an incorrectly-rejected migration across XenServer's Xen
4.13 -> 4.17 upgrade, as Xapi is slowly growing the logic to check a VM
against the target max policy.
