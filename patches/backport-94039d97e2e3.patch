Subject: amd-vi: set IOMMU page table levels based on guest reported paddr
 width
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

However take into account the minimum number of levels required by unity maps
when setting the page table levels.

The previous setting of the page table levels for PV guests based on the
highest RAM address was bogus, as there can be other non-RAM regions past the
highest RAM address that need to be mapped, for example device MMIO.

For HVM we also take amd_iommu_min_paging_mode into account, however if unity
maps require more than 4 levels attempting to add those will currently fail at
the p2m level, as 4 levels is the maximum supported.
