    libxl: a domain can be dying but not shutdown
    
    The shutdown code is only present if the domain is shutdown.
    If we attempt to extract it from the flags from a dying but not
    shutdown domain then we get values like '255' which is not a
    valid LIBXL_SHUTDOWN_REASON_. We should use LIBXL_SHUTDOWN_UNKNOWN
    in this case.

    This can be tested by running 2 domUs, and having one map pages from
    the other. I used a vchan connection, so I had a vchan_server granting
    pages and a vchan_client mapping them. I made sure the client is
    never going to unmap the pages (I used 'sleep' in a Mirage kernel but
    'xl pause' from outside would probably also work) and then I
    'xl destroyed' the server. The server domain ends up stuck in the dying
    state because the client still has a page mapped. The server domain
    is not shutdown.
    
    According to 'xl list':
    
    djs@st20:~/djs55/list$ sudo xl list
    Name                                        ID   Mem VCPUs      State   Time(s)
    Domain-0                                     0  5278     6     r-----   10971.2
    fedora                                      12  2048     1     -b----    5470.0
    (null)                                      21     0     1     -bp--d      25.1
    vchan_client                                22   256     1     -b----       0.0
    
    and according to my test program which calls libxl_list_domain:
    
    domain 0 shutdown = 0 dying = 0 shutdown_reason = -1
    domain 12 shutdown = 0 dying = 0 shutdown_reason = -1
    domain 21 shutdown = 0 dying = 1 shutdown_reason = 255
    domain 22 shutdown = 0 dying = 0 shutdown_reason = -1
    
    I believe this also manifests transiently during a normal 'xl destroy'.
    
    Cheers,
    Dave
